## Updating packages

Using this template might mean some of the packages pre installed are not deprecated. And that is because some packaged get updated with time. To update all packages on this template please follow the following instrucations:

```sh
rm -r node_modules
cp package.json package.json.bak
sed -E 's/"\^.+"/"*"/' package.json.bak >package.json
npm update --save
npm update --save-dev
  # note: make sure it works
rm package.json.bak
```
- all of the versions will be updated with an `*`. Then npm updates grab the latest version and replace.

Dependencies are stored in [`package.json`](package.json).

Do not configure `grunt` packages directly in the
[`Gruntfile.js`](Gruntfile.js). Instead, store configurations in the
[`grunt`](grunt) directory. You won't need a top-level key, since that's
generated by the `Gruntfile.js` based on the filename of the configuration
object stored in the `grunt` directory.

**Note:** developers who add link tags should be firmly reminded to follow
directions

## Linux Troubleshooting

Very rarely, `package-lock.json` can cause a problem for Linux users. If
`npm install` is failing on Linux or developers are seeing errors related to
missing dependencies or modules, they should:

```
git rm package-lock.json
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
git add package-lock.json
git commit
```
